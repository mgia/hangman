# Hangman
Who doesn't love Hangman? (Well, except the hanging man himself)

## Overview

I built this project to supplement a course curriculum for HackHighSchool prepared by @KaiDrumm. For educational purposes, 
code is written in long but simpler form and commented generously to assist students.

## How to use

Populate the input file with words to choose from.
Next, run this command:
python main.py
